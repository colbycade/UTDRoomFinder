This is a web app that allows UTD students to find unoccupied rooms on campus to study in.  

Code is split between collecting classroom data and the web app itself.  

Instructions for running both data collection scripts as well as the server and frontend locally are found in the README files.   
Additionally, a demo is hosted at https://utdroomfinder.pythonanywhere.com.
